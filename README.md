To run this program add the included src,lib, and gradle.build files to your
gradle project. You can change configurations in the initial config.conf file and this is
where you will also choose to run simulation and if you would like map reduce on or off
if you would like to use map reduce on change false to true. If you would like to run a simulation
choose a number and the program will run simulation#.conf as the config file where # is the number
entered in config.conf. From here you are ready to being running the program just type 
gradle build then gradle run in terminal if this does not work try gradlew build and then 
gradlew run. Now you are running the cloud simulator with the config file or simulations
specified.
